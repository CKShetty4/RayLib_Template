###### Important Configuration Changes:

- `Makefile`: Navigate to Line 27 and replace "ProjectName" with the actual name of your project. This is crucial to ensure the correct output binary is generated.

- `src/main.cpp`: Instructions are embedded in the code comments. However, if no further modifications were made to the template, ensure the project name on Line 9 matches the name set in the Makefile. This step is essential for maintaining consistency across your project.
